## Project 2

In this project, I wrote programs that would support an application for a rental car service. Classes include Vehicle, Individual, Cargo, Passenger, and VehicleLog.
The Vehicle base class public attributes are inherited by the Individual, Cargo, and Passenger derived classes. 
The VehicleLog class contains a vector of vehicle elements, and it can read an input file and load the vehicle information in the vector.
A Date class was also implemented since the inspection date of the vehicle is listed in the input file.
