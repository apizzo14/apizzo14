## Twitter Support dataset

In this project I used a large dataset containing twitter support data (tweets to and from companies about service issues, etc.).
I created a class Company that constructs a dataframe for the specified company that contains all the tweets sent to and from. 
The Company class can also calculate the number of conversations for each company as well as return as specific conversation given an index.
In another function I found the longest conversation involving a customer and the VirginAtlantic help desk.
