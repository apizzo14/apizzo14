## Analyze YouTube Trending

Using a large dataset containing data on trending YouTube data for various countries on each day from Nov 2017 to June 2018, I created a dataframe containing the title of the video with the most views in a single day (popTitle), the date of the day with the most views over all videos (busiestDay), and the title of the video with the most views in a single day that did not trend (i.e. is not in the dataset) in any other country (uniquepopTitle). 
Using ggplot, I made visualizations displaying the total number of view over all videos on each day for each country, as well as the number of videos viewed in each country on each day of the week.
