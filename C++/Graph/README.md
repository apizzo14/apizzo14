This project contains implementation for a graph data structure using an adjacency list. The main function reads in an input file containing all vertices of the graph and the costs of the edges between them. The input file also contains a query containing two vertices in the graph, and my project will find the shortest path between the two vertices. This is accomplished by using Dijkstra's algroithm and a priority queue.
