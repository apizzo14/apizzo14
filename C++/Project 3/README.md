## Project 3

In this project, I utilized a doubly linked list, with pointers to both the next node and previous node.
The doubly linked list is implemented in the Node and LL classes, which are both template classes. 
The LL class has member functions that allow for the manipulation of the list, adding or removing a node anywhere in the list.
Searching and sorting functions have also been implemented as part of the LL class: bubbleSort, selectionSort, insertionSort, linearSearch, binarySearch
