In this project, I created 2 hashtable implementations, one using chaining to handle collisions and the other using quadratic probing. The main function reads an dictionary file, creates a hashtable with all words contained in the dictionary, then spellchecks a second input file by comparing the words contained in it to the words contained in the dictionary hash table. Example input files include The Federalist Papers and A Tale of Two Cities.
