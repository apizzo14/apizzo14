## Analyze Baseball Data

In this project, I analyzed baseball data from separate datasets containing salary, pitching, and inflation data.
From the datasets, I constructed a dataframe that contained the ERA and salary (adjusted for inflation) data for each player in each year from 1985-2014.
This dataframe was then collapsed to contain data for the average ERA and salary for each year from 1985-2014.
Using ggplot, I made visualizations to display the relationships between year, ERA, and salary.
